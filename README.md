# My Open-Source Software

My open-source software can be found under @jackadull, so if you are looking for my code, please go there.

I chose to create a separate GitHub organization for my public open-source projects.

Here, under my GitHub user profile, you will only find less interesting stuff, such as:

* My IntellJ IDEA settings repository
* Temporary forks of other open-source projects that I may want to contribute to
* Projects that I haven't decided yet to make open source "officially", but I still wanted to put the source code somewhere public

## Rationale

There are good reasons to create a separate GitHub organization for one's open-source projects.
Here are two:

* If at some point, I choose to let others participate in maintaining my open-source software, there is nothing to change.
  I can simply add them as team members to my open-source GitHub organization.
  My own, personal projects remain with me exclusively, however.

* My open-source projects get released to [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~jackadull) as Maven artifacts.
  Again, should I want to include other people as team members, or choose to transfer ownership completely, I can do so easily without migration of personal details.

In short, should I wish to add more team members, or transfer ownership of the projects, this can be done independently from my personal matters.
